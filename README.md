# VBA-challenge
Challenge 2

In this challenge I created a calculator using VBA code to scan ticker symbol and identify non-zero open price and extract close price for the same ticker in order to calculate yearly change 
as well as percent change as well. it also highlights positive yearlychange in Green and negative in Red.The code runs through all the worksheets in the workbook

Once the first analysis is completed, a second analysis is conducted to get the following 

1- Greatest % Increase in yearlychange
2- Greatest % Decrease in yearlychange
3- Greatest Total Volume from all the stock tickers

As a note to the person marking this. I tried my best to identify zero open price and skip them in my loop since we can't mathemtically "divide by zero in terms of percentchange % formula"
I have run it for the alphablitic test sheet, but my computer kept breaking down when i did it for the main sheet, so apologies for that. Please let me know if you have any questions!
